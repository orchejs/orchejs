## <a name="aoj"></a> About Orchejs

The Orchejs project provides a set of libraries aggregating key technologies and consolidated libraries for the development of APIs in Node.js.

The goal is to make the backend development in Node.js even more productive, organized and that promotes scalability and maintainability.

This module is used internally by other orchejs projects. Briefly it contains utilities classes, decorators and loaders that are shared between the projects.
